# Movie Moods

## Purpose
This website is designed for all the users who want to know details about a specific movie such as the year of creation, ratings, a description, the writers, the actors, the genre, and also a cool movie poster. We also give you a few options if you don't know what to watch, we give you a variety of genre options you can choose from, and depending on your choices random posters will be displayed.
